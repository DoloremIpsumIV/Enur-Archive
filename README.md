# Enur-Archive
This is basically just an archive of a teachers webbsite because i really enjoy his work and he's going into retirement. One of his courses and webbsites have already been replaced and so i want to archive his stuff just in case he decides to take them away or if his webb server shuts down. A complete passion project for no real reason other than im really bored and procrastinating :D. So if you're curious about interactive webb development (html, css, js) and speak swedish (Alot should be understandable for an english speaker aswell) then i highly recommend looking at his stuff. It's suprisingly detailed and there are tons of fun stuff. None of this is mine and i claim zero credit, all goes to Rune Körnefors and his incredible sense of attention to detail and sometimes cheeky humor. Much appreciation from a student who is really not motivated to study, you make things really fun and easy to understand! 

Thank you Rune!!!
